z80-board-tools
==================

This contains stuff for building some tools for my z80 board project.

Currently tested on OSX and Fedora 27

in some cases, build-*.sh files exist. These are used as helpers to set environment
variables before invoking make. They pass all arguments through to make.

Most of the tools in here are not actually all that useful to most people right now!
